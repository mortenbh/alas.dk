  One of the main concerns of computer graphics is in creating physically plausible
  representations of the real world. Fluids are extremely prevalent in this world,
  which has led graphics researchers to pour extensive resources into the development
  of new methods for visual animation of fluids. However, tractable and fully
  three-dimensional simulation of large bodies of water, such as ponds and rivers,
  has eluded researchers so far. We argue that approximation is necessary to simulate
  such phenomena. We thus seek a tractable and visually plausible analogue that
  stays as true to the original three-dimensional physics as possible.
  
  In this vein, we propose a novel hybrid approach for simulating large bodies of
  water where surface tracking and three-dimensional fluid flow is computed at two
  different resolutions. As much information as possible about the surface location is
  fed back into the three-dimensional solver and excess resolution is turned into little
  waves in a two-dimensional approximation. Furthermore, we leverage information
  about pressure from the three-dimensional solver to determine the speed of the small
  two-dimensional waves.
  
  We also propose a simple new physics-inspired approach to handle artifacts at
  the solid boundary caused by excess resolution of the surface. Information about
  pressure from the three-dimensional solver is used to determine a force that moves
  the surface towards solid boundaries.
  
  By combining these two approaches, we believe we have achieved a method
  balancing efficiency and capability, where the latter refers to the wide variety of
  interesting liquid phenomena we can simulate with the method. We believe our
  method will be interesting and valuable to researcher implementers alike.
