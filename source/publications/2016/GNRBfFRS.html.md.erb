abstract: |
  When aiming to seamlessly integrate a fluid simulation into a larger scenario
  (like an open ocean), careful attention must be paid to boundary conditions. In
  particular, one must implement special "non-reflecting" boundary conditions,
  which dissipate out-going waves as they exit the simulation. Unfortunately, the
  state of the art in non-reflecting boundary conditions (perfectly-matched
  layers, or PMLs) only permits trivially simple inflow/outflow conditions, so
  there is no reliable way to integrate a fluid simulation into a more
  complicated environment like a stormy ocean or a turbulent river.

  This paper introduces the first method for combining non-reflecting boundary
  conditions based on PMLs with inflow/outflow boundary conditions that vary
  arbitrarily throughout space and time. Our algorithm is a generalization of
  state-of-the-art mean-flow boundary conditions in the computational fluid
  dynamics literature, and it allows for seamless integration of a fluid
  simulation into much more complicated environments. Our method also opens the
  door for previously-unseen post-process effects like retroactively changing the
  location of solid obstacles, and locally increasing the visual detail of a
  pre-existing simulation.

    Given an input fluid simulation (top left), our algorithm can make local
    changes retroactively and seamlessly re-integrate them into the original fluid
    simulation. Here, we locally edit solid geometry (top right), add a cow splash
    (bottom left), or re-simulate a specific region at a higher resolution (bottom
    right). Please see our video.
