abstract: |
  Computer graphics is an extremely exciting field for two reasons. On the one
  hand, there is a healthy injection of pragmatism coming from the visual effects
  industry that want robust algorithms that work so they can produce results at an
  increasingly frantic pace. On the other hand, they must always try to push the
  envelope and achieve the impossible to wow their audiences in the next
  blockbuster, which means that the industry has not succumb to conservatism,
  and there is *plenty* of room to try out new and *crazy* ideas if
  there is a chance that it will pan into something useful.

  Water simulation has been in visual effects for decades, however it still
  remains extremely challenging because of its high computational cost and
  difficult art-directability.  The work in this thesis tries to address some of
  these difficulties. Specifically, we make the following three novel
  contributions to the state-of-the-art in water simulation for visual effects.
