Hi! I am Morten, a Danish computer graphics researcher living in Vienna, Austria, who loves physics-based animation.

I received my PhD from [IST Austria](http://pub.ist.ac.at/) in 2016 under the supervision of [Professor Chris Wojtan](http://pub.ist.ac.at/group_wojtan). Before that, I studied computer science (Master, 2011;
Bachelor 2009) at the [Department of Computer Science](http://cs.au.dk) at [Aarhus University](http://au.dk) in Denmark.
